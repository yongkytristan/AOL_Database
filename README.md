# AOL_Database

This was the final project for the Database Technology course. For this project, our team chose the food industry as the theme and developed a system for an online food delivery service.
From the dataset we obtained, I performed data preprocessing, identifying anomalies from the UNF (Unnormalized Form) and then normalizing the data into 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF. We also designed a relational database based on the normalized data. My role in the project was to collect the dataset and write SQL queries based on the relational database structure to support various data operations.
Through this project, I learned how to design and implement a relational database, apply normalization principles, and develop efficient SQL queries to manage and retrieve data effectively.
